# Wifi Bars
*Old signal bars style wifi bars for iOS - Winterboard theme* by **gabry3795**

This is the source of winterboard theme on Cydia - [see here](http://cydia.saurik.com/package/org.thebigboss.wifibarsio76theme/)

## Note
I can't recompile the tweak for iOS9+ because I left Apple devices, but **you can if you want**. Just fork this repo and update it, then make a pull request
